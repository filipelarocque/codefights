Exercise Description:

    Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

    A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon
    is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to
    its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.

Example:

    For n = 2, the output should be
    shapeArea(n) = 5;
    
    For n = 3, the output should be
    shapeArea(n) = 13.

Solution code:
    
    int shapeArea(int n) {
        return n * n + (n - 1) * (n - 1);
    }
