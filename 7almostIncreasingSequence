Exercise Description:
    
    Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing
    sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Example:
    
    For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
    almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;
    
    There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

    For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
    almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

    You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove
    2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

Solution code:
    
    boolean almostIncreasingSequence(int[] seq) {
    
        int fail = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seq.length - 1; i++) {
            if (seq[i + 1] <= seq[i]) {
            
                fail++;
                if (fail > 1)
                    return false;
                if (i > 0 &&
                    i < seq.length - 2 && 
                    seq[i + 1] <= seq[i - 1] &&
                    seq[i + 2] <= seq[i])
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
